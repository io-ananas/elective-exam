        <p class="paragraphe1-about">
          It was only in 1994 that it became possible to play the Oddset.
          Initially, one had to combine several matches when playing at Den
          Lange, and the odds were not updated when the program had left the
          press.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraphe2-about">
        At that time one couldn't play singles. Instead, you should constantly
        combine their matches with others, which increased the risk. Today,
        Danske Spil has fortunately been modernized, and both the games offering
        and the possibilities have been increased. <br />
        <br />
        Besides Den Lange, the other products under the umbrella have also
        experienced an optimization, so that today you get far better odds than
        you did at the start. One must therefore say that Danske Spil took the
        spoon in the other hand, as the gaming market was liberalized on 1
        January 2012.
